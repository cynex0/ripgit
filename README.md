# ripgit ðŸ¦€

**ripgit** is an attempt to reimagine Git, written entirely in Rust.
This project is a learning experience and not meant for production use.

## Purpose

Instead of a boring desciption, I wrote a haiku:
```
Each borrow a step
A cub seeks to learn the way - 
Basics turn to skill 
```

## Features

**ripgit** is **not** a feature-complete Git, and will probably never be.
Currently, it has these features implemented:
- Blazingly fast
