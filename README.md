# ripgit ðŸ¦€

**ripgit** is an attempt to reimagine Git, written entirely in Rust.
This project is a learning experience and not meant for production use.

---

## Purpose

The goal of **ripgit** is to serve as a learning experience for diving deeper into Rust and the inner workings of version control systems.

---

## Features

**ripgit** is **not** a feature-complete Git, and will probably never be.
Currently, it has these features implemented:
- Blazingly fast
